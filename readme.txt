Camera calibration using two methods (OpenCV and finding the vanishing points) 
Method 1: Using OpenCV to calibrate camera with the images of a checkboard from different angles.
          These images can be bound at img/calibrationOpenCV/
Method 2: Vanishing point method 
          Find the vanishing points in an image (here img/checkerboardCube) and calculate the K matrix using Cholesky decomposition.
Please refer to the report to see more details about the maths.
